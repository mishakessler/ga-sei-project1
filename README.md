<h1>MentalHealthable</h1>

<em>A curated feed for all your modern mental health needs.</em>
  
  <h2>Core Aim:</h2>
  
  MentalHealthable will use NewsAPI V2 to feature curated feeds of content related to mental healthcare technology. 
  
  <h2>Method:</h2>
  Using Google Search Console to avoid personal bias in keyword selection, MentalHealthable will create a main feed by selecting multiple keywords related to positive mental health content ("mindfulness", "inspiration", "mood", etc.) and technology ("apps", "wearables", "trackers"). Each related term will use "OR" tags, while categories will be concatenated with an "AND" tag, as allowed by the advanced NewsAPI query, casting a wide net across news media and blogging websites. Certain anti-keywords will be utilized to avoid including any potentially triggering or graphic content. Category specific pages ("tech", "apps", etc.) would contain content specific to each category; a search function would be available to reference all queries in the NewsAPI database.
  
  <h2>Stretch Goals:</h2>
  Utilizing the Youtube and Instagram APIs to intersperse unique and original content into the curated feeds. Including advanced alt tags and descriptions for accessibility readers. 
  
<br>
  
<h1>Design:</h1>
  
  Immersive, fullwidth design with minimal content and backgrounds, a simple color palette, and advanced CSS elements such as box shadows, parralax scrolling, and interactice hover elements– putting the API-called content front and center, allowing for a pleasant viewing experience– will be utilized. For accessibility needs, MentalHealthable will feature full WCAG 2.0 compliance and restricted use of low-contrast or low-transparency elements.
